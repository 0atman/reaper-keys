# Modes

Reaper-keys has multiple modes. Depending on the mode one is in, the available action sequences (thus also the available key bindings) may change. The way the actions in the action sequences compose may also change.

The available action sequences available for all modes are:

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">

<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">command</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>


<a id="orgb46f6ae"></a>
